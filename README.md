# Groupie Tracker Visualizations
This project aims to manipulate data retrieved from an API and present it in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The implementation of the project should adhere to Schneiderman's 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design, which are as follows:

1. **Design dialogue to yield closure:** Design dialogues and interactions in a way that gives users a sense of completion and closure. Clearly indicate the beginning, middle, and end of a task or interaction to help users understand the system's behavior.

2. **Enable frequent users to use shortcuts:** Provide shortcuts or efficient methods for experienced users to accomplish tasks more quickly. This can include keyboard shortcuts, quick access menus, or personalized settings.

3. **Offer informative feedback:** Give users clear and meaningful feedback when they perform actions. This feedback can be in the form of visual cues, progress indicators, or status messages to keep users informed about the system's response.

4. **Permit easy reversal of actions:** Allow users to undo or reverse their actions easily. This feature provides a safety net for users to correct mistakes or explore different options without fear of irreversible consequences.

5. **Reduce short-term memory load:** Minimize the cognitive load on users' short-term memory by organizing information in a logical and intuitive manner. Use visual aids, clear labels, and contextual cues to make tasks and options easier to understand and remember.

6. **Strive for consistency:** Ensure that the design elements, layout, and interaction patterns are consistent throughout the application. This consistency helps users develop a mental model and navigate the interface more easily.

7. **Support internal locus of control:** Ensure that users feel in control and can predict the system's behavior. Provide clear and consistent cues to help users understand how to interact with the interface and achieve their goals.
